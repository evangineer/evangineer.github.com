<p>Globalisation has brought many benefits in terms of price &amp; availability of goods &amp; services, foreign exchange etc..  It has also brought costs in terms of lengthened supply chains, job offshoring, compromised food security, exposure to global economic turmoil etc..  A certain amount of re-localisation can act as a buffer to protect a community from the adverse effects of globalisation while still enabling them to reap the benefits from it.  Depending on how the re-localisation is done, the community can become more resilient, self-sufficient, sustainable and paradoxically better able to attract external trade and investment due to the increase in local social and knowledge capital.</p>
<h1><a id="Layers-of-Economies" href="#a9476960" class="list" title="Return to Contents">2</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#Layers-of-Economies" class="here" title="Permanent hyperlink to this section">Layers of Economies</a></h1>
<p>One way of looking at economies is to consider them to be similar to the atmosphere with different layers which exhibit variying properties with some degree of overlap and fluidity: so we have the <em>global economy</em> where the dominant reserve currency was the petrodollar, but a transition to the Euro seems to be underway; there&#8217;s the <em>national economy</em> where market transactions are conducted primarily in the currency which is legal tender; the <em>personal or &#8220;core&#8221; economy</em> which operates amongst family, friends and neighbours where the currency is favours.</p>
<p>Communities can often have problems due to insufficient inflow of money from the national and global economies.  This can be alleviated by establishing a new economic layer, a local economy based on the creation of a local form of exchange which mobilizes local spare capacity in the form of skills and resources effectively in an area where people are otherwise <em>money-poor and time-rich</em>.  Money has many functions, one of the key ones being an information system that brokers the allocation of services and resources.</p>
<h1><a id="Identifying-Key-Functions-of-Local-Exchange" href="#a9474740" class="list" title="Return to Contents">3</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#Identifying-Key-Functions-of-Local-Exchange" class="here" title="Permanent hyperlink to this section">Identifying Key Functions of Local Exchange</a></h1>
<p>Any form of local exchange that incorporates and optimizes the <em>information system</em> function of money will have a much greater positive impact on the local economy then one that does not.  In fact, we could talk about <em>information-rich</em> vs <em>information-poor</em>, however in the context of a local economy, what we are specifically interested in are offers and wants, skills and resources.  A resource could be a field, a drill or a room for example.  There are many different skills existent in any community, but they will fall under three main categories, skills with things, with information and with people.  The real wealth of a community lies in the skills and resources available to the people in it.  A well-designed information system can not only make this wealth visible, it can liberate it for the greater benefit of the community and all who live in it.</p>
<p>Money as Debt/Credit leads to another aspect of the ecosystem around exchange, the trustworthiness of the parties involved in an exchange.  In national and global economies, this is where credit ratings come into play.  A form of local exchange that incorporated notions related to trust and reputation would be more robust than one that didn&#8217;t.</p>
<h1><a id="What-Kind-of-Local-Exchange" href="#a9472940" class="list" title="Return to Contents">4</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="#What-Kind-of-Local-Exchange" class="here" title="Permanent hyperlink to this section">What Kind of Local Exchange?</a></h1>
<p>The oldest form of exchange, one that predated the invention of money is <em>barter</em>.The direct exchange of goods for other goods between two parties otherwise known as swapping.  However this does not scale due to the time and complexity involved in doing more complex barter transactions.  The difficulty and cost of complex barter transactions led to the invention of mediums of exchange that would evolve into the currencies that we refer to as money.  The key point here is that money is used to mediate transactions.  However, the role of money here can be replaced by an information system that is purpose built to facilitate and enable complex multi-party barter either directly or indirectly through what could be called a local or complementary currency.  One highly successful, established version of barter that is used by business and operates on a global scale is BarterCard</p>
<p>Another form of exchange is to treat <em>Time As Money</em> and exchange hours of service for resources and/or other services.  There are many schemes around the world based on this form of exchange such as <em>Timebanks</em>, <em>Timedollars</em> and <em>Ithaca Hours</em>.  Within timebanking circles, it is a tenet that time is most suited as a form of exchange in the personal economy and within the service-based portion of the local economy.</p>
<p>A form of exchange that is also used in a number of schemes is <em>mutual credit</em> where personally issued IOUs denominated in a local currency are exchanged for goods and services.  There are many schemes around the world operating on this principle including various <em>Local Exchange and Trading Systems</em> (aka <em><span class="caps">LETS</span></em>) and <em>Berkshares</em>.</p>
<p>The aforementioned are the most popular and understood alternative forms of exchange besides vouchers and loyalty schemes such as iTunes Gift Vouchers, Tesco ClubCard and Air Miles.</p>

<p>We can make use of the web and mobile phones to enable local exchanges for the benefit of the local economy by creating a system that does the accounting, brokerage and other &#8220;information system&#8221; type functions that are normally enabled by money and the ecosystem around it.  There are already a number of systems available to do this to varying degrees.  However, there are none available that can facilitate the scale and quality of collaboration needed to ensure that the local economy not only survives but thrives and enables the community to develop in a resilient, sustainable way that can attract external trade and investment even in adverse global economic conditions.</p>
<p>Such a system would support the community to make decisions as a whole or as smaller groups as appropriate.  It would support the management of projects and tasks for the collective benefit of the community as well as subsets of it.  It would support the pooling of skills and resources, then helping with the management of them.  Utilizing tools like maps and calendars would make it easier to find available goods, services and resources and engage in appropriate exchanges of them, including where appropriate the use of money in part payment thus enabling the local economy to more efficiently connect to the national and global economies.  Powerful communications capabilities would be inherent in the system.</p>
<p>The bottom line is enabling effective collective action via the local economy for the benefit of the community and all who are part of it even though they may be <em>money poor and time rich</em>.  Doing so unleashes the true <em>wealth of communities</em> that the national and global economies all often overlook.</p>
