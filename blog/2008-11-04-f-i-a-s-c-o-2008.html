  <div class="body"><p>I&#8217;m part way through <a href="http://www.profilebooks.co.uk/title.php?titleissue_id=64">F.I.A.S.C.O.</a> which is Frank Partnoy&#8217;s account of life as a derivative salesman in Morgan Stanley&#8217;s Derivatives Planning Group.  It&#8217;s a fascinating and at times borderline horrific insider&#8217;s view of how derivatives are created and sold.  Regarding one particular structured note that was quite successful for Morgan Stanley (<span class="caps">PERLS</span>), he identifies two categories of buyers, &#8220;cheaters&#8221; and &#8220;widows and orphans&#8221;.  &#8220;Widows and orphans&#8221; are buyers such as local authorities/municipalities, insurance companies and schools who typically have no idea what a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yield_curve">yield curve</a> is, and therefore have no real idea of the risk/reward equation involved in buying a derivative.  Therefore it is extremely likely that they will be missold a derivative with a far higher risk than they are aware of by a salesman who is &#8220;ripping the face off&#8221; of his woefully ignorant clients.</p>
<p>So why did I explain the above.  Partnoy is describing what was already an established practice by 1993.  There have been allegations that Partnoy has made exaggerations and offers little evidence to backup what he says.  Be that as it may, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/02/business/02global.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;oref=slogin">this New York Times article</a> describes how one particular set of widows and orphans, a group of Wisconsin school districts were persuaded to borrow the best part of $200 million and invest it in collataralized debt obligations (the very same credit derivatives at the heart of the credit crunch).  Reading the story, it is clear that they and the New York subway authorities have had their faces ripped off and are now suffering the resulting pain.  How many other widows and orphans are out there with ripped off faces and what will the implications be in terms of their being able to meet their financial obligations such as paying salaries and pensions, not to mention cover their operating costs.  Budget cuts and job losses for schools, hospitals and local public services around the world but particularly in North America and Western Europe seem inevitable as a result of this.</p>
<p>One key reform that policymakers may want to consider in the light of this are banning unregulated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over-the-counter_trading">over the counter</a> derivatives and instead only allowing properly regulated <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_trading">exchange-traded</a> derivatives, so that there is greater visibility about what is going on.  Another more controversial measure is to either nationalize the credit ratings agencies or break them up applying reforms to ensure that they aren&#8217;t complicit in giving unwarranted ratings to undeserving financial instruments just because they are getting paid to do so by the investment bankers working for the issuer of the instruments.  As things stand, credit ratings agencies like auditors are pretty much inherently corrupt because their remuneration and business models incentivizes them to be corrupt.  Just as massive cash bonuses based on short-term performances incentivizes investment bankers to engage in lucrative high-risk transactions regardless of the medium/long-term impact on their employers and clients.</p>
