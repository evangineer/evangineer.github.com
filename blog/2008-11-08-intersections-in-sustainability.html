  <div class="body"><p>Last Thursday, I attended the <a href="http://www.createkx.org.uk/NewsDetail.aspa?PageId=1253&amp;NodeId=215">Intersections in Sustainability</a> event organized by <a href="http://www.createkx.org.uk/default.aspa">Create KX</a>.  The venue is <a href="http://the-hub.net/places/kingscross.html">The Hub King&#8217;s Cross</a>.  It&#8217;s the first time, I&#8217;ve been there since they finished the renovations.  I&#8217;ve been there before when it was a newly acquired disused site and the difference is night and day.  The place is like something out of <a href="http://www.channel4.com/4homes/on-tv/grand-designs/">Grand Designs</a> with quite stunning interiors.</p>
<p>The event was facilitated by <a href="http://i-genius.org/member/profile.php/id/14">Tommy Hutchinson</a> of <a href="http://i-genius.org/">i-genius</a></p>
<p>First speaker was James Wallbank, an artist and free technology activist who also directs the art &amp; technology group <a href="http://www.lowtech.org">Redundant Technology Initiative</a>, and is the <span class="caps">CEO</span> of <a href="http://access-space.org/">Access Space</a>.  He spoke about his view that technology is changing society.  Sheffield in the mid-90s was in poor shape with a low level of <span class="caps">ICT</span> skills.  James as an unemployed artist, decided to take the computers that were being skipped and put them to cool, creative use.  Wound up with nearly 2,500 computers.  More computers than they know what to do with.  Founded Access Space in 2000 as a open access space in order to find ways of using those computers.</p>
<p>Reusing is better than recycling, but requires a high level of skill.  Treats visitors not as customers but as participants.  Encourages them to collaborate, teach and support each other. James believes in harnessing collective intelligence and teaching people how to participate in a community again as the majority of us in this society have never learned about how to truly be in community.  One key is being positive with affirming creative contributions, while shunning takers.</p>
<p>James says that it&#8217;s about everything, he&#8217;s had to consider every aspect of what he does, not just financially but also socially and otherwise.  A future way of business may be that everything is important.</p>
<p>Starting to engage with the idea of <span class="caps">ICT</span> for Development.  In the meantime, they are pursuing two initiatives:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Grow Your Own Medialab &#8211; helping others setup something like Access Space.</li>
	<li>Zero Dollar Laptop &#8211; Taking disused dust-gathering laptops, making them functional and giving them away to people who can make use of the renovated machines.</li>
</ul>
<p>My thoughts: Q: What&#8217;s the relationship between the Redundant Technology Initiative and Remade in Brixton?  Can we grow a set of connected youth-focused medialabs around South London.</p>
<p>The next speaker Damian Kimmelman is director and developer at <a href="http://www.wearevi.com/">Vivid Image</a>.  He questioned the idea of necessity being the mother of invention.  He spoke about applying design principles such as building websites according to the lowest common denominator in terms of computer capabilities using graceful degradation. They aren&#8217;t necessarily constraints on creativity, but may instead be the launch pad for it.  An example he gave was of streaming video without buffering on low bandwidth internet connections.</p>
<p>He gave examples of ways in which technologies are being re-purposed in a multitude of new and unforseen ways:</p>
<ul>
	<li>iPhones and Wii&#8217;s both make heavy and innovative use of accelerometers for motion detection.  Acclerometers have been around for years but are new to consumer electronics.</li>
	<li><a href="http://news.google.com/news?num=30&amp;hl=en&amp;client=safari&amp;rls=en-us&amp;q=heart%20printer%20nakamura&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wn">Creating heart organs using printers</a>, sounds unbelievable doesn&#8217;t it?</li>
	<li>Transferring airtime minutes between villages in Africa using mobile phones.  Turning airtime into a new form of currency.  I do believe something like that is happening in Kenya.</li>
	<li>Anti-spam technology in the form of <a href="http://recaptcha.net/">Recaptcha</a> being used to digitize books and newspapers in a similar fashion to <a href="https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome">Amazon Mechanical Turk</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Damian was clearly put off his stride by being unable to show the relevant web pages from his laptop.  The Hub has invested in a projector that apparently only works with Apple laptops with <span class="caps">DVI</span> connectors.  James was also unable to hook up his laptop but displayed what he had to show via the third speaker&#8217;s laptop.</p>
<p>Graham Harwood being the third speaker in question sported an Apple laptop which worked with the projector but not with the Hub&#8217;s audio setup, so when he showed his video, there was no soundtrack to go with it.  So Harwood spoke about <a href="http://www.mediashed.org/">The MediaShed</a>, a free media space setup by the now defunct <a href="http://www.mongrel.org.uk">Mongrel</a> artists group in Southend.  Mediashed is about free media in order to replace money with imagination.  Harwood defines free media in similar terms to free software as described by Richard Stallman.</p>
<p>One of the projects undertaken by the MediaShed was <a href="http://www.mediashed.org/videosniffincom">video sniffing in shops</a>.  Apparently you can take one of the video senders used to retransmit multi-channel TV around the house and use it to pick up footage from <span class="caps">CCTV</span> cameras.</p>
<p>Having proven the concept, MediaShed went to the Manchester Arndale Shoppng Centre, and <a href="http://www.mediashed.org/duellists">used the inhouse <span class="caps">CCTV</span> for filming two free runners doing their thing over three nights in the centre</a>.  The resulting film was shown for several days on the big plasma screens at the Arndale.</p>
<p>One of Harwood&#8217;s <a href="http://www.mediashed.org/gold">Interactive Media M.A. students at Goldsmith&#8217;s</a> is going beyond Video Sniffing to Signal Hijacking sending games and videos to surveillance cameras using a modified variant of video sending technology.</p>
<p>A number of other projects mentioned by Harwood are <a href="http://adj.mediashed.org/">Antarctic Data Jam</a>, <a href="http://www.mediashed.org/awsom">Ambient Weather Sound Machine</a>, and Social Telephony, kind of like a text to audio twitter on the radio.</p>
<p>One example of Social Telephony was A Roundhead using Oliver Cromwell as a persona for a mental hospital.  The voice of Cromwell would call in various messages to staff at the hospital.  Apparently this was successful and well received by both staff and management.  For a London-based Congolese refugee community radio programme on <a href="http://www.resonancefm.com/">Resonance FM</a>, they did <a href="http://www.mediashed.org/trottoire">Telephone Trottoire</a>.  The refugees are displaced due to conflicts over coltan, a source of tantalum which is used for mobile phones. Almon Strowger invented the switch for direct dial. Harwood and his colleagues have reconstructed six Strowger switches in San Jose as part of a <a href="http://www.mediashed.org/TantalumMemorial">Tantalum Memorial</a>.</p>
<p>For the next Tantalum Memorial, they are according to Harwood reanimating twenty six switches for the Science Museum in an upcoming exhibition in the near future.  One key theme of the work by Harwood and the MediaShed is our apparent transition from a society that imprisons the body to one that controls us and curtails our freedoms.</p>
<p>All in all much food for thought from all the speakers, with new ideas and possibilities for collaboration afoot.</p>
